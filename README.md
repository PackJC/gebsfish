# Mod Goals
To add 19 new freshwater fish, 20 new saltwater fish, 1 new freshwater crustacean and 8 new saltwater crustaceans. This mod is meant to create more immersion, and add more to the ecosystem to the base game. We do not want the fish to make it easier to survive, so the percentage of catching, time to prepare, amount of fish fillets gathered, and fish weight are considered.

This mod currently adds 39 unique fish, new tackle boxes, bug and minnow catcher, 4 Spinners, 4 Lures, 6 knives, 3 insect fish bait, 1 rubber bait, 2 fishing gloves, 4 fish themed hats, 4 fish themed tshirts, and 4 fishing rods to the game. That's a lot of variety.
