# Mod Information
This mod currently adds 41 new fish, 9 crustaceans, 6 knives, 8 lures/baits, 21 tackle boxes, 7 tools, 4 insect baits, 10 clothing items.

This mod is meant to create more immersion, and add more to the ecosystem to the base game. We do not want the fish to make it easier to survive, so the percentage of catching, time to prepare, amount of fish fillets gathered, and fish weight are considered. 

# Features

- We allow very detailed configuration to fishing. The config is created in the your server $profile/gebsfish/fishingsettings.json. 


- You can define where a fish is caught, salt, fresh or both types of water. How a fish is caught, fish traps or fishing rod. The range of fillets you may get from gutting a fish. The probability of catching said fish as well. If you have any issues with your config please join the discord for troubleshooting. 


- Predators of your choosing has a chance of spawning around the player when fishing or gutting a fish. This is defined in the config as well. You may disable, decrease or increase the chance of this happening. You may also change the predator that spawns on the player.


- Junk being caught is also now configurable. You can choose which junk classes you'd like to add in the config. Liquid containers can be added in the section below junk - detailed in the config.


- CFTools logging is used to help debug issues.

# Adjust Fishing Chances
In the config under Catch Probability is where you define the chance of catching a fish. We recommend 0-25. If you wish to disable a fish being caught, set it to 0.


# Adjust Predator Chances
The default currently is 0.25 for the predator to spawn, if you wish to make this more rare, try setting it to 0.05.
